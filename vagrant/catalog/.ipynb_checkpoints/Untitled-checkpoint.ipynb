    "# Item Catalog Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The web application provides a list of items within a variety of categories and integrates third party user registration and authentication. Authenticated users should have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin coding, there are several steps that you should take to make sure that you have everything downloaded in order to run your future web application.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The virtual machine Installation\n",
    "Install Vagrant and VirtualBox if you have not done so already. Instructions on how to do so can be found on the websites as well as [this website](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud088/vagrant).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install two pieces of software:\n",
    "- VirtualBox, which you can get from [this download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\n",
    "- Vagrant, which you can get from [this download page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need a Unix-style terminal program. On Mac or Linux systems, you can use the built-in Terminal. On Windows, we recommend Git Bash, which is installed with the Git version control software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository\n",
    "There is a catalog folder provided [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm&sa=D&ust=1572660516735000), but no files have been included. If a catalog folder does not exist, simply create your own inside of the vagrant folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch the Vagrant VM \n",
    "Launch the Vagrant VM (by typing vagrant up in the directory fullstack/vagrant from the terminal). You can find further instructions on how to do so [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud088/vagrant&sa=D&ust=1572660516736000).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Python files:\n",

    "-\tThe **`categoryiteminfo_loggedIn.html`** same as **`categoryiteminfo.html`**, but only for logged-in users. It also gives the **Delete** and **Edit** options of the item to the logged-in user. \n",
    "-\tThe **`editcategoryitem.html`** page will aloow the logged-in user to modify the information of the item.\n",
    "-\tThe **`deletecategoryitem.html`** page will aloow the logged-in user to delete the selected item from category. It will ask for confirmation before deleting the item.\n",
    "-\tThe **`newcategoryitem.html`** page will aloow the logged-in user to add a new item to the selected category. \n",
    "-\tThe **`login.html`** page shows the Google API login button and runs it t authenticate the user with OAuth2 method.\n",
    "-\tThe **`main.html`** file contains the links to **`styles.css`** and **`bootstrap.min.css`** files and block container to be used for all pages. It prevents us from repeating same HTML header for each pages.\n",

    "## Run the application\n",
    "Run your application within the VM by typing python /vagrant/catalog/application.py into the Terminal. If you named the file from step 4 as something other than application.py, in the above command substitute in the file name on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally on your browser.\n",
